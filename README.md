Pico Datalogger with Integrated Power-Management
================================================

This is a hardware and software solution for low-frequency
data-logging with a Raspberry Pi Pico (W). The project started as a
hardware project, but the software runs independently of the special
hardware (PCBs) provided in this repository (see some example setups
as provided in the `examples` folder). Nevertheless, the full function
set of the software is not available with standard components.

Besides logging data to a SD-card, the dataloggers can send data to a
central system (called "gateway"). Normally the gateway acts as a
relay to upstream systems, but it could do anything with the data. See
[Gateway Application Firmware](docs/software_gateway.md) for details.


Core software functions
-----------------------

  * implemented in CircuitPython
  * support for an external RTC for exact time keeping
  * cyclical sensor readout for a wide range of environmental
    [sensors](docs/sensors.md) (currently 18 directly support
    including Open-Meteo weather data)
  * supports I2C (two busses), UART-3V3 and UART-5V devices
  * support I2C-multiplexers (PCA954xA, TCA954xA)
  * readout in intervals or using a time-table
  * implementation of additional sensors only need a small wrapper class
    (given a driver-library is available)
  * logging of data to a micro-SD card or equivalent (e.g. XTSD-chip)
  * configurable post-collection [tasks](docs/tasks.md)
    (e.g. update of a display, sending data using WLAN or LoRa)
  * send data to a gateway (see below)
  * power-optimized programs
  * [web-interface](docs/admin_mode.md) for configuration and data download
  * no programming required for standard setups
  * supports (almost) zero current sleep with specialized hardware


Core hardware functions (PCBs)
------------------------------

  * power management for extremly low standby current (about 1ÂµA)
  * embedded XTSD-chip (emulates a micro-SD card)
  * connectors (Pico, Stemma/Qt, UART)
  * JST-PH2 connector for LiPo or battery pack (two AA/AAA)
  * a sensor PCB with a number of standard sensors
    (temperature, humidity, light, noise)

The design has gone through multiple iterations, you
can find images of these versions in the `docs` folder.
